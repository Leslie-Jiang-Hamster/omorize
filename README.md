# omorize

Some scripts to change your wallpaper to random omori fan arts! OMO

# prerequisites

- Gnome Desktop Environment
- shuf & gsettings (They're installed at default on Ubuntu, but I still recommend to give it a check and see if they work well)

# how to use

```
python3 main.py
```

Of course you can make it a crontab!

# config

Just change the `wallpaper_dir` in config.py to your background folder, full path required.
